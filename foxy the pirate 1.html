<p><strong>Moving Path:</strong> Foxy is a unique character in the game because, unlike the other animatronics (excluding Freddy Fazbear), his movement pattern is entirely set. He starts at Pirate Cove,
<br>inside of the closed curtain, next peeking out of the curtain, then, starts to walk for the West Hall. However,
<br>once he becomes aggressive from either not being viewed enough or being monitored too much (starting from Night 3),
<br>he leaves Pirate Cove and <a href="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141006023057/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/8/89/Foxysprinthq.gif" title="foxy rush down the west hall">rushes down the West Hall</a> towards the Office. He does not appear anywhere else.
<p><strong>Foxy</strong> (also fully known as Foxy the Pirate[1]) is an animatronic pirate fox as well as an antagonist in Five Nights at Freddy's.
<br>His starting location is behind the curtain in Pirate Cove, from which he will emerge and sprint towards the Office
<br>to attack the night guard on any given night if he is not monitored enough or monitored too much through the security camera.

  <br><strong>Jumpscare</strong>
<p>Unlike the other animatronics in the game, Foxy will hide for a while before coming to attack the night guard, depending on how much he is watched or not watched.
<p>Like the other animatronics, Foxy will try to forcefully stuff any human spotted after-hours into a Freddy Fazbear suit, resulting in death.
<p>Foxy hides behind his curtain in Pirate Cove throughout the game. Over the course of the night, the player must use the Monitor periodically.
<br>They must also monitor Pirate Cove in a balance between "too much" and "too little" to prevent Foxy from emerging from his curtain and sprinting towards the Office.
This balance may be difficult to find, but it is essentisal for preventing Foxy from ending the night early.
<br>Foxy's attacks seem to be based on a timer, rather than being random. If Foxy's AI is set to 20 on Night 7 and Pirate Cove is never checked, he will always bang on the door at either 32 or 38-second intervals (tested on V1.1).

<p>This is because sometimes, when he retreats, he will immediately return to Phase 2 instead of going back behind the curtains.
<br>He is also much more active on the mobile version to compensate for shorter nights. He will sometimes run back when his A.I. levels are quite high.

<p><strong>Phases</strong>
<br>Initially, Foxy is completely hidden behind the curtain.
<br>The curtain is parted slightly, allowing the player to view Foxy's face, upper half, and part of his bare legs.
<br>Foxy has left from behind the curtain, and is now in front of the camera, shrouded in darkness, with the only indication of his presence being his glowing eyes and outline. His head is also tilted sharply to the left.
<br>Foxy will precede his attack by leaving the curtains wide open. Sometimes, the sign reading "Sorry! Out of Order" will change to display the phrase "IT'S ME", a message commonly associated with hallucinations. Foxy himself is nowhere to be seen within Pirate Cove. At this point, if the Monitor is lowered immediately and the left door is closed, the player can then view CAM 2A to safely trigger Foxy's sprinting animation.
<br>Foxy has now left Pirate Cove and will begin to rush to the night guard's location. When viewing the West Hall (on CAM 2A), the player will briefly see Foxy sprinting towards the security room. At this point, the player either must have already closed the door or must close it immediately, though they are very unlikely to succeed after having spotted his sprint.
<br>If the player's attempt to block off the left doorway has succeeded, Foxy will bang on the door a few times, and then his position will reset back to behind the drapes in Pirate Cove (he can, however, reset straight to Phase 2 on the more difficult nights or settings). When Foxy bangs on the door, the player will lose a small portion of their power, the first time draining 1 percent of power, the second time draining 6 percent, third being 11 percent. If the player's attempt to close the <br>left door has failed, Foxy will quickly lean into The Office and screech. The screen will then go to static, and will result in a "Game Over".
