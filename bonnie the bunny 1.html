<br><strong>Moving path: Bonnie's starting location is the Show Stage, along with his bandmates Freddy and Chica. Upon activation,
  he will move to any room on the left side of the restaurant, excluding Pirate Cove. This means he can appear in the Dining Area,
  Backstage, the West Hall, the Supply Closet, and the West Hall Corner. When looking into the Office,
  he appears, leaning into the left doorway from the blind spot directly behind the left door.</strong>
<p>A purple rabbit robot doing a red bow tie. It's the band's bassist.
<br>Unusually, there are no eyebrows, and the mouth protrudes abnormally like a hippopotamus.
<p>The teeth are only present in the lower part, and the teeth are very rough compared to other animatronics.
<br>Official sex is male. At first, many people misunderstood as women.
<br>It is the first to move after the game starts, and it is also the most frequent animatronic.
<br>The movement speed is very fast and especially active until the third night.
<br>It is the speed at which there is no threat after the third night.
<p>Unlike other animatronics that move from the room where he was to the nearest room, this guy moves anywhere.
<br>It is more dangerous because it moves irregularly and moves faster than Chica.
<br>I always come in the guard room to the left door.
<br>You wait for a moment at the door, so you can see if there is a bonnie if you light the light.
<br>When you are in the air in front of the door, close your eyes half way and stare at the player, I look tired or annoyed.
<br>If you have left Bonnie for more than a certain amount of time, you come in and attack the player.

<p>When he breaks into the security guard, he makes a terrible moaning sound like a child suffocating.
<br>This is the same for chika. At game over, with an extremely rare chance <a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/lmn/image/upload/fl_lossy,q_80/f_auto/v1/gameskinny/03b40c2140f1a19535e2754cce9b0cd3.jpg" title="bonnie's easter egg">(surprise) Bonnie's Easter comes out.</a>
<br>Especially, when CAM 2B is watching the player with the lens down, it is very creepy.
<br><img src="none-eyes bonnie.jpg" width="450">
<p>From the first day to the second day, the player is the most threatened player, and the jump scorer is also very intense and dynamic,
  <br>so the player who plays for the first time is the one who is most afraid of him.
  <br>It is also the most frightful animatronic of the developer, and during the development period, he has had several nightmares associated with Bonnie.
<br>It is quite scary because it is covered by Foxy in CCTV. <a href="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140921053825/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/d/dc/Bonnie_ECH.gif">(Surprise Attention) When you come to the room next to the guard room,
<br>you can shake your head at a high speed</a>, <a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/lmn/image/upload/fl_lossy,q_80/f_auto/v1/gameskinny/7c0dd1b79f9062678e9d2d9dba81c42f.jpg">(Surprise Attention), to look at the player by covering the entire CCTV screen,</a> etc.,
<br>Bonnie 's Easter, without eyes, is also quite frightening.
