<p><h2>Five Nights At Freddy's</h2>

<br>title: <strong>The start of everything</strong>
<br>
<p><strong>¡°	During the day, it's a place of joy... But you aren't here during the day. You have the night watch. ¡±</strong>
<br></br>
It's the first game of the FNAF series
<br>player starts the game in the security office. and the player can check the CCTV around the pizzaria with tablet.
<br>and there are electric operated doors on the left and right sides of the guard room.
<br>Instead, all of these functions require power, which limits the amount of power that can be used overnight,
 and even if you do not use any function,<br>power is reduced slightly because of the lights and fans in the guard.
<br>This means that if you do not use power, the door is still open.
<br>It also means that if the door is still open, it is quite and very bad for the player.
<br>There is also a switch on the bottom of the door <strong>opening / closing</strong> switch that turns on and off the lights outside the door,
<br>so you can check if someone comes outside the room. If you turn on the lights, if animatronics is right in front of you, you can hear the <strong>creepy sound effects</strong>.
<br><img src="fnaf 1 map.png" width="70%">
<br>At the corner of the building are animatronics, where the animatronics, which were still at the start of the game,
<br>begin to move somewhere between the glance of the player. When I look around with a surveillance camera,
<br>there is a sudden jittery noise and I can not see anything.
<br>When I check again, animatronics is instantly moving. Sometimes Easter Egg posters, wallpapers, signposts, etc.
<p>Game over when animatronics reaches the guard room with player. It is safe to close the doors on both sides,
<br>but there is a limit to the amount of electricity used overnight, so if you use too much power, there will be a power failure and you will not be able to use all the functions.
<br>Even if the door is closed, when the power fails, the door automatically opens and Freddy gets hit.
<br>It is impossible to monitor unlimited animatronics as CCTV consumes power.
<p>Sometimes doors or light buttons do not work because <strong>they are already in the room.</strong>
<br>If you hit 6 o'clock in the moment of raising and lowering the monitor, you will not see the laptop or you will be able to hold it up without raising it.
<br>If you do not have a lot of batteries, then using a laptop is a good way to get Freddie to get cancer quickly and give you a quick strike,
<br>so this should be done when you have plenty of battery.
<br>It is a problem because the foxes that come to stay without seeing the notebook come.
<br>In other words, once you allow an intrusion, all you can do is punish the hour.
<p>It starts at midnight and goes to the next day at 6 am.
<br>Even if a blackout or an animatronic appearance begins, you can survive at 6 o'clock before you hit the player.
