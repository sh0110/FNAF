<br>Golden Freddy's original form (referred to as Yellow Bear in the first game's files)
<br>is a hallucination-like animatronic in Five Nights at Freddy's.
<p>He is a secret, golden colored version of Freddy Fazbear who appears in the Office
<br>after a certain sequence of events are triggered.
<p><strong>Appearance</strong>
<br><strong>¡°	FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S "Graphic designed animatronic bipedal gold colored bear,
Freddy Fazbear, wearing black top-hat, bow-tie, and holding microphone."	¡±</strong>
<p>Golden Freddy appears to be a yellow colored variation of Freddy Fazbear with missing eyes.
<br>His hat and bow tie appear to be tinted dark blue, as opposed to Freddy's black ones though this may be the result of lighting. Upon closer inspection, a microphone can be seen lying on his right palm, as well as two pinprick white dot-like pupils within his otherwise empty eye sockets.
His paws are facing palms up.
<br>It is also possible that there is an endoskeleton in the suit. If one looks at the arms, a few wires and parts of the endoskeleton are visible,
<br>which share the same coloration as his accessories, though this may just be cords holding together the separate pieces of his suit. His jaw hangs open and his head is tilted to the right.
<br>He is also presented in a sitting, slouched position as if he were deceased.
<p><strong>Behavior</strong>
<p><img src="golden freddy w.hall cam 2B.jpg" width="500">
<br>When checking CAM 2B, the player will see a poster on the wall.
<br>It can switch between three different versions: a normal picture of Freddy, a distorted version (in which he appears to rip off his own head),
<br>or a close-up of Golden Freddy's face. While this picture of him is being viewed, a young girl's laugh can be heard.

<br>If the player sees the Golden Freddy poster and then switches back to the Office, Golden Freddy will be waiting for them.
<br>His appearance causes different images to flash on the screen for split seconds,
<br>along with the words "IT'S ME". Golden Freddy will wait idly for few seconds before killing the night guard, forcibly closing the game.
<br>This does happen in the mobile version but the chances of it occurring are much lower than the PC version.
<p>Unlike all of the other animatronics in the game, Golden Freddy does not give any indication of approach or arrival within the Office.
<br>He completely disregards the doors, appearing whether they are open or closed.
<br>Unlike the other animatronics, the screen will be covered by a static image of Golden Freddy's face upon attack, akin to the images that flash during Mike Schmidt's hallucinations.
<p>The moment the player sees him, the player must bring up the Monitor before Golden Freddy kills the night guard.
<br>Doing so will cause him to disappear, thus preventing death and a game shutdown.
<p>Alternatively, the player can avoid him entirely by simply not looking at the West Hall Corner camera poster (CAM 2B),
<br>which will prevent him from being summoned in the first place. However, this may prove difficult,
<br>as players may be tempted to watch this particular corner in case Bonnie is making a move toward the Office.
