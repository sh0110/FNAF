  <p>Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator is the sixth installment in the Five Nights at Freddy's series.
    <br>The game's save-data file is titled FNAF6, strongly suggesting that it falls within the canonical lineup of games.
    <br>The game is chronologically the sequel to Five Nights at Freddy's 3.
<p>As the title suggests, this game's main focus is running a pizzeria and making sure it is a safe environment.
  <br>Failure to do so may result in getting sued, and possibly blacklisted if sued too many times.
  <br>The true gameplay of the game, however, after finishing their pizzeria, forces the player to sit after closing time to fend off the salvaged animatronics
  <br>that lurk inside while they finish their tasks.
<p><h2>summary</h2>
  <p>Start your own Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria with Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria Simulator!
  <p>Presenting a fun Five Nights at Freddy's adventure with a lighter touch for the holidays,
    <br>Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator puts you in charge of developing your own restaurant! Design pizzas,
    <br>feed kids, and get high scores!
