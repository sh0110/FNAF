<p> The sign character of this game, also shown on the game icon.
<br>A brown bear wearing a silk hat and a bow tie is animatronics, who is the band's lead singer.
<br>Until the second day, it does not come out well on the show stage, but starts on the third day and begins to attract the player.
<br>It is always one of the most active animatics ever.
<p>When Freddie moves, a low laugh sound is heard.
<p>There are two types of jump scare: attack from the right door with reversed eye color, attack from the left door in case of power failure.
<br>It depends on how you invaded.

<p>The general invasion route is show stage ¡æ restaurant ¡æ toilets ¡æ kitchen ¡æ east hall ¡æ east hall corner ¡æ guard room. Unlike Chica,
<br>he does not stand in front of the guard's door and comes in straight away. If Freddie is in the kitchen, the music box sounds.
<br>When Freddy is moving and you hear a laughing sound, watch the CCTV.
<br>As Freddie's difficulty rises, the frequency of laughter increases, so let's just put a habit of closing the right door before watching CCTV.
<p></p>If you have exhausted all the power, you will see only the light of the eye outside the left door in the middle of the darkness,
<br>the light flashes for a certain period of time and you will hear <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soZkoGtzU4Ythe" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soZkoGtzU4Ythe"> music box version of the toreador in Carmen It disappeared for a while and then attacked.</a>
<br>If another animatronic was attacking when a power failure occurs, the attack of that animatronic will be canceled immediately.
<p>If the player does not turn his head and fixes his gaze on the left door, he can take off as long as possible,
<br>but if he turns his gaze, he will attack at random. Either way, I do not wait too long. This song is like playing in the kitchen.
<br>Freddy blinked his eyes, but if he disappeared, he could live at 6 o'clock before attacking.
<p>Freddie is not captured when he is with other animatronics, and is often difficult to spot because he stands in a dark corner compared to other animatronics.
<br>In the dark areas far from the security guard, I can see only weak light shine at best by lighting my eyes.
<p>So it's roughly <a href="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140825033550/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/0/00/Cam1B_freddy.png" title="freddy's lighting eyes">like this.</a><a href="http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140825031536/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/0/0c/DiningArea_Freddy.png" title="freddy's lighting eyes more light version">(the light version)</a> It's not a big deal, but Freddie is quite appalled when <strong>he hunts players in a strategic hiding.</strong>
<br>It may be that Freddie does not move for two days to observe the player. In addition, when Freddie reached the guard,
<br>he stared at the entire surveillance camera. I've been hiding for a while, and suddenly I'm in a decisive moment.
<br>Thanks to it, you can barely clear the 5th night only if you close your door as soon as you can see it.
