<br>It is a mascot used in <strong>Freddy fazbear's pizza.</strong>
<br>There are lots of paintings by children in various places in the shop which are popular.

<p>It is like a child's friend during the day and a symbol of Freddy fazbear's pizza,
<br>but at night it's all aimed at a night guard, and if you allow access, you will be attacked and attacked in front of you.
<br>The robots are generally quite popular,
<br>and the fact that they are truncated at the rear end of the game file is the closest thing to changing the scream of a young child.
