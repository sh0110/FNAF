<br><strong> Moving path:</strong> Like Bonnie and Freddy, Chica starts the night on the Show Stage. When she leaves the Show Stage, Chica may then go to the Kitchen, Restrooms, Dining Area, and East Hall.
<p>Her movements are somewhat random, but she always approaches from the right side.
<br>The player can activate the Hall Lights to check if she's in the blind spot.
<br>As Chica gets closer to the Office, her jaw opens wider as she nears.
<br>Chica also seems to twitch wildly when she's at the East Hall Corner, though this only occurs on the fourth, fifth, and sixth night, as well as on the Custom Night.
She's also the only animatronic who can access the Kitchen area on the first two nights.
<br>A clashing of pots and pans will be audible, and Chica will not be visible in any other room.

<p>onnie may be active on the first day if she is unlucky because she starts to work and then moves on.
<br>The behavior is the simplest in comparison to other animatronics. They travel only to adjacent areas, sometimes going into the bathroom or kitchen.
<br>When approaching, always go to the right door, and when it comes to the door, the waiting time for invasion is slightly longer than it looks.
<br>Sometimes it keeps the player annoying for a long time.
<p>On the seventh day, Freddie comes so often that if he raises the difficulty of Freddie, he will lose his presence.
<br>If this guy is in the right aisle, just check it often. However, there are cases where the battery is exhausted because it is dealing with chica.

<br>Unlike other animatronics, which have relatively little change in expression, Chika is constantly making a tough, bloody look and behaving strangely,
<br><strong>like Bonnie quickly rattling her head and gazing at the camera.</strong>
<br>Still, it does not block the whole screen like Bonnie, so there are few horror productions compared to other animatronics.
<p>In contrast to Bonnie, Chica approaches from the "right" on pages 1, 2, and 4. However, in the second part, Toyichica approaches from the left vent.
